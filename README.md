# TXTcalendar
My father is visually impaired and thus can not use visual digital calendars like most of us. I therefore created this text calendar generator tool for him. A year is typed in and then ENTER is pressed. By default, a txt calendar for the specified year will appear on the user's desktop. This version currently outputs a calendar in Icelandic. An example of the contents of a 2015 generated calendar:

Janúar

Fimmtudagur, 1. janúar


Föstudagur, 2. janúar


Laugardagur, 3. janúar
...

and so on until the 31st of December.

He would then be able to write stuff he wanted to get done each day. He'd only have to do CTRL + F and type in the current day to navigate to that day. His screenreader would then easily read each line of the day, making it easy for him to add more things to his day.
